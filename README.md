# Unsafe keyword code patterns

This repository aims to create a database of unsafe keywords in major programming languages.

The repository will consist of a list of keywords that generally target insecure code but can lead to a false positive; a manual analysis of static code is always necessary to better evaluate.

These keywords are dangerous functions or methods. So, to use them, it is necessary to surround them with user input sanitization, protections, and more.

Let's enrich these insecure keywords. This repository is for the #infosec community. If you have more dangerous functions or methods, please open an issue or pull a request. It will be a pleasure to add your recommendation, and if at the moment you do not have a proposal, a star will be awesome too.
